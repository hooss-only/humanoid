# Humanoid

An arduino robot project.<br>
If you want to see how it works, you can watch the video in my [blog post](https://blog.naver.com/hooss_only/223457547151)<br>

Thanks to my shcool([KNUHS](https://knu.dge.hs.kr/knuh/main.do)) club, [Makers](https://www.instagram.com/makers_knuhs/), for many supports(money, motor, arduino mega, bunch of tools, etc).

# Pin Connection

Eyes vertical servo motor -> Digital 4<br>
Eyes horizontal servo motor -> Digital 5<br>
Remote control reciver -> Digital 7<br>

# How to make

1. You have to print and assemble (add more)<br>
2. Arduino project folder is 'humanoid' folder inside of our project.<br>
3. Connect pins according to the [#Pin Connection](#pin-connection)<br>
4. Then, you have to upload the arduino project to your arduino with arduino ide(or cli).<br>
5. When you don't have some libraries to run this code, you can download those in the arduino-cli or arduino IDE.<br>
<br>

# How to use

After uploading, you can remote it with IR remote controller.<br>
1. Press the 'part button'. the part button is number buttons. each number means each parts.<br>
1 for eyes, 2 for heads (add more).
2. After choosing parts, you can control with 9 buttons above the number buttons. For example, to roll the eyes, you can use 4 keys(arranged in a cross) of those as arrow keys.
3. Then, press '0' button to exit the part, and choose another part move again.
4. Finally, make your robot's posture as desired.

# Thanks for reading

As I'm young, not English native and definitely very first to post arduino project repo, my README could be not good.<br>
I'm very welcome supporting to my project with PR.<br>
